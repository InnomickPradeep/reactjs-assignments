### Objectives

After this exercise, you should be able to know:

- What are the different types of http methods ?
- how each http method works ?

### Example
The Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) is designed to enable communications between clients and servers.

HTTP works as a request-response protocol between a client and server.

Example: A client (browser) sends an HTTP request to the server; then the server returns a response to the client. The response contains status information about the request and may also contain the requested content.

1	GET
The GET method is used to retrieve information from the given server using a given URI. Requests using GET should only retrieve data and should have no other effect on the data.

2	POST
A POST request is used to send data to the server, for example, customer information, file upload, etc. using HTML forms.

3	PUT
Replaces all current representations of the target resource with the uploaded content.

4	DELETE
Removes all current representations of the target resource given by a URI.
